What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git creates the .git directory so that it can keep track of this project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is only in git, while the working directory is where the file actually exists on disk.  Its' value is in that it allows git to keep track of which files should be committed.
