What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git creates the .git directory so that it can keep track of this project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is only in git, while the working directory is where the file actually exists on disk.  Its' value is in that it allows git to keep track of which files should be committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  You could use git diff, or git diff --staged to check that you have one logical change to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

  If you wanted to try something that may not work, and if it was more than a trival change, then a new brance may be a good idea.
