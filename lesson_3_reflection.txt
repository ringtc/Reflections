When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You could use the remote repository to work with others on the same project, or to work
  from more than one computer, or just as an offsite backup.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A fork is used only to make a copy of a repository on GitHub.  A clone can be made from GitHub
  go a local repository, or from one local repository to another one.  A branch is made when 
  one wants to try something new.  It can be made on a local repository or on GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  If I am going to be offline for some time and I may need to merge in changes from the origin,
  this provides a way to do that.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  Without using GitHub, we would have to talk about each change that we wanted to make, before 
  we could make them.  This would waste much time and would not allow us to just try things
  whenever we wanted to.  The part that would be easier would be that there's nothing to learn
  first.  You just talk and work.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  When two or more people are working on the same part of the same file, having a seperate branch
  may help to keep things manageable.
